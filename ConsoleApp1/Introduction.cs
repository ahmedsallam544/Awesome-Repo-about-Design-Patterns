		//Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
		//Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so.
		//Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions to problems, not solutions finding problems; so don't overthink.
		//If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior;
		//or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.
